### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
- My name is Enakshi, and I am a passionate learner based out of India. 
- I'm currently pursuing two degrees simultaneously - Computer Science and Business Systems, as well as a BSc in Economics.
- I'm excited to share with you a curation of some of my completed projects on GitHub. These projects showcase some of my skills and interests, and I'm always adding more to the list.
- I believe that learning should never stop, and I'm always on the lookout for new knowledge and skills to add to my arsenal as well as implementing the same through different projects.
